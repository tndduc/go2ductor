# Spring Boot Appointment Booking App Go2Doctor ( RESTful API )

## This is a Spring Boot application that allows users to book appointments with doctors. The application uses JWT authentication and authorization to secure its APIs.

## Requirements
> - Java 11
> - Maven
> - MySQL
> - Installation
## Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/tndduc/go2ductor
```
Create a MySQL database named appointment_booking.

## Update the application.properties file with the following information:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/appointment_booking
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
```
## Build the application:
```
mvn clean install
Run the application:
mvn spring-boot:run
```
## Usage
The application exposes the following APIs:

- /api/appointments: Get all appointments.
- /api/appointments/add: Create a new appointment.
- /api/appointments/edit: Edit an appointment.
- /api/appointments/delete: Delete an appointment.
## To authenticate with the application, you need to send a JWT token in the Authorization header of your request. You can generate a JWT token by using the following command:
```
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
```
## Then, use the following command to generate a JWT token:
```
java -jar jwt-generator-cli.jar -keystore private_key.pem -alias my_key -secret my_secret -subject "user"
```
## For example, the following request will get all appointments:

curl -X GET 

- -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiIsImV4cCI6MTYzNjU3Njk4NSwiaWF0IjoxNjMzNTc0OTg1fQ.7_18r245b3Y32-k9-k9-k9-k9-k9-k9-k9" 

- http://localhost:8080/api/appointments
